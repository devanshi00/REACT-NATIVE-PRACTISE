  {/*Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
For example, the HTML:

<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
is slightly different in React:

<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button> 
*/}
 
 <Button title='Press Here' onPress={testName} color={'green'}></Button>
      
      
    </View>
  );
};
