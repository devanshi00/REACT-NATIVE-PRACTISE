# REACT-NATIVE-PRACTISE
Here I Have Added some bits of codes used for creating the following projects. The components folder contains many .txt files which may be converted to .js files and run on emulator . Personally I used android studio emulator and have also used npm packages. All the files uploaded have been successfully run on android studio emulator PIXEL XL API 31.
ALso in current App.js file I have used code for stack navigation in between the screens login and home.
